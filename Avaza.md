# Data Documentation File: Use of Avaza for Scheduling and Invoicing Tasks

## Objective
This document provides guidance on how to use Avaza for task scheduling and accessing invoicing schedules. It outlines roles, processes, and responsibilities to ensure effective data management and collaboration.

## How / Where Analytics Resourcing is Done
The analytics resourcing process is documented [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MyXntQ24Oqg54x16FsLG6divE8BDW5fhXQGXCX6dCSI/edit?tab=t.0). Analytics’ team broad assignment is managed weekly and updated in the Avaza Team schedule.

### 1.1 Understanding Project Priority
Knowing how important each project is in relation to the others is essential for efficient management of resourcing within the Analytics team.  
Prioritization is done primarily via resourcing, where analytics resources are assigned different projects and time allocation. Every PM or resource requestor should expect to have access to a fraction of an analyst/engineer roughly based on the hours resources for the week.  
Other more urgent requests are raised to the team lead for triaging. In order to establish priorities, the following factors are considered:

- **Invoicing Deadlines**: Prioritize projects that have an effect on cash flow and are linked to invoicing timelines or milestones.
- **Workshops and Presentations**: Prioritize projects that have important client milestones not related to payments, such as incoming presentations and workshops.
- **Requirements and Direction from Management**: Some initiatives and priorities are derived specifically from Exec and management requests that supersede others for business reasons.
- **Internal vs Client Project**: Important projects that are in line with strategic goals or customer expectations generally take precedence over internal duties, but some internal projects are also required at times to maintain the working of the team (e.g. hiring, software upgrades, etc).  
For transparency, some of this information is also available in Avaza.

## Resources for Understanding Assignment

### 2.1 Avaza Team Schedule
The analytics team resourcing assignment is visible in the [Avaza Team Schedule](https://onasystems.avaza.com/schedule). If you don’t have access to this functionality, you may request the Avaza admins (e.g. Joyce) to add you if needed.

### 2.2 Project Invoicing Schedule
Project prioritization is highly influenced by deliverables and invoicing. Those are all visible in Avaza.  
Use these instructions to access the deliverables and invoicing schedule for a particular project:

1. **Filter by Assigned Projects and Tasks**
   - Navigate to the Tasks section in Avaza.
   - Use the Filter to:
     - Select Tasks for the PROJECT MANAGER whose workload you want to review (e.g. For invoicing against CPIMS project, search tasks for Bilhah).
     - Select Status: “Payment - Not Started”, “Payment - In Progress” to identify the tasks related to outstanding invoices.
   - This will display a list of all tasks and projects assigned to the individual.

2. **Assess Project Attributes**
   - Look at the project details and attributes to determine its priority:
     - **Deadline**: Projects with the nearest deadlines are typically higher in priority.
   
3. **Review Priority Levels**
   - Avaza allows you to set priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) for tasks. This is not often used, but if available it can give some indication of urgency. 
   - If tasks have Priority, you can sort the tasks by their assigned priority to focus on what needs immediate attention.

4. **Check Related Milestones**
   - Click on the project name to view its goals.
   - Determine whether the project ties directly to invoicing, workshops, or other significant events. Projects linked to financial outcomes or client satisfaction should be treated as higher priority.
