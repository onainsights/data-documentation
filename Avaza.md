# Analytics Resourcing Process

The analytics resourcing process is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MyXntQ24Oqg54x16FsLG6divE8BDW5fhXQGXCX6dCSI/edit?tab=t.0). The Analytics team’s broad assignments are managed weekly and updated in the **Avaza Team Schedule**.

## 1. Understanding Project Priority

Efficient management of resourcing within the Analytics team requires understanding the relative importance of each project. Prioritization is done primarily via resourcing, where analytics resources are assigned to different projects with specific time allocations. 

### 1.1 Key Factors for Prioritization
- **Invoicing Deadlines**: Prioritize projects affecting cash flow, invoicing timelines, or milestones.
- **Workshops and Presentations**: Focus on projects with client milestones like presentations or workshops.
- **Requirements and Direction from Management**: Exec and management-driven initiatives may supersede others for business reasons.
- **Internal vs Client Projects**: Customer-focused projects aligned with strategic goals take precedence. Internal projects may be prioritized when necessary (e.g., hiring, software upgrades).
  
For transparency, some of this information is available in **Avaza**.

## 2. Resources for Understanding Assignment

### 2.1 Avaza Team Schedule
The Analytics Team's resourcing assignment is visible in the **Avaza Team Schedule**.  
- **Access**: If you don’t have access, request the Avaza admins (e.g., Joyce) to add you.

### 2.2 Project Invoicing Schedule
Project prioritization is influenced by deliverables and invoicing, all of which are visible in **Avaza**.

#### Steps to Access Deliverables and Invoicing Schedule:
1. **Filter by Assigned Projects and Tasks**  
   - Navigate to the **Tasks** section in Avaza.
   - Use the filter options to:  
     - Select tasks for the **Project Manager** whose workload you want to review (e.g., for invoicing against the CPIMS project, search tasks for Bilhah).  
     - Select statuses like **“Payment - Not Started”** or **“Payment - In Progress”** to identify tasks related to outstanding invoices.  
   - This will display a list of all tasks and projects assigned to the individual.

2. **Assess Project Attributes**  
   - **Deadline**: Projects with the nearest deadlines are typically higher priority.

3. **Review Priority Levels**  
   - If available, use Avaza’s priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to sort tasks by urgency.  

4. **Check Related Milestones**  
   - Click on the project name to view its goals.  
   - Determine whether the project ties directly to invoicing, workshops, or other significant events. Projects linked to financial outcomes or client satisfaction should be treated as higher priority.
